# Trading platform comparisons

I'm going to be looking at a few trading platforms and will likely choose the simplest one.


## Webull

Webull has shown up as a no-fee (i.e., paid by market makers rather than users) platform with surprisingly fast execution.  Notably, it also offers _paper trading_, where you can test strategies with no money down and see them tracked against the market for you.  The paper trading feature is particularly attractive.

## Wealthfront

While not a trading platform in the typical sense, you can easily buy/sell stocks and ETFs.  Since I already use Wealthfront for its other financial services, it's relatively easy for me to use for long positions.
