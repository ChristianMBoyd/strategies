# Trading platform comparisons

I'm going to be looking at a few trading platforms and will likely choose the simplest one.


## Webull

Webull has shown up as a no-fee (i.e., paid by market makers rather than users) platform with surprisingly fast execution.  Notably, it also offers _paper trading_, where you can test strategies with no money down and see them tracked against the market for you.  The paper trading feature is particularly attractive.


### Paper trading

Since the paper trading is such an attractive feature, I wanted to call out some restrictions from Webull's documentation.
- Paper trading is not limited by real-world liquidity.  In principle, you can buy and sell more than exists, and without the market moving against you.
- "Corporate actions" don't influence paper traded options the same way.  The position is simply closed at market close instead of mimicking the real-world adjustments.s

## Wealthfront

While not a trading platform in the typical sense, you can easily buy/sell stocks and ETFs.  Since I already use Wealthfront for its other financial services, it's relatively easy for me to use for long positions.
