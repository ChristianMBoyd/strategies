    "I've been rather interested in how the market--a suitably broad index of American stocks--grows over time, and the remarkably sustainable market performance over around 30 years.  Since dividend re-investment is such a fundamental aspect of long-term investing, I'm naturally drawn to the question of whether the current era of stock buybacks could have long-term effects on investment returns.  The appeal of stock buybacks is clear: deferred taxes until you actually close your position, at which point the relevant tax penalties are based on short or long term capital gains.  I wonder, however, if the more nebulous aspects are really understood.  E.g.,:  \n",
    "- Do stock buybacks manipulate buy signals to drive prices higher, or is there an instrinsic reason for prices to rise?\n",
    "- Does the value delivered to investors outweigh the tax penalty on dividends?\n",
    "- Does the market effectively price in stock buybacks?  If not, why?\n",
    "- Don't stock buybacks overly concentrate an investors portfolio?  Wouldn't the dividend be preferable as diversifying with up-to-date information?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to test out various analyses in what follows, first by assuming the efficient market hypothesis (suitably defined) and later allowing for mispricing.  Eventually, I'd like to backtest strategies based on dividendifying buybacks, but that may have to wait for further analysis."

    "In what follows, I consider a scenario where a company returns a dividend to shareholders and a separate scenario where a company executes a share buyback.  I'm assuming that the this process can be understood from market data established suitably before and suitably after the divided or buyback; if the announcement is crucial to the market pricing, then I include it within the dividend/buyback process.  In particular, I will consider the market capitalization $M$,  \n",

    "By \"efficient market pricing,\" I mean that the market capitalization before executing a return to shareholders essentially prices in this return.  I.e., the return is predicted sufficiently soon that the present value of the predicted payout more or less mirrors the actual amount returned to shareholders.  Specifically, I'm assuming that we can choose times before and after the return (in either mechanism) such that  \n",

    "Perhaps controversially (or incorrectly), I'm assuming the same change in market capitalization before and after the buyback ($M_f = M_i - d$).  My reasoning is that, if the company has $d$ to payout to shareholders, then I'm analyzing the expense as that.  If the company buys shares speculatively, then I wouldn't consider that a return to shareholders, but some sort of company financial activity, which itself may be worth further shareholder discussion.  In particular, the amount \"returned\" would necessarily be less than the amount spent ($d$) after the re-issuance of the shares.  Alternatively, the company might buy shares as a hedge against a payout.  If things are going well, the treasury stock could be re-issued to raise capital or as incentives to employees.  If things go poorly, the treasury stock could be retired and marked down as a return to shareholders.  In both of these latter cases, I would have preferred an initial dividend payout.\n",
