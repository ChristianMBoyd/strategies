    "I've been rather interested in how the market--a suitably broad index of American stocks--grows over time, and the remarkably sustainable market performance over around 30 years.  Since dividend re-investment is such a fundamental aspect of long-term investing, I'm naturally drawn to the question of whether the current era of stock buybacks could have long-term effects on investment returns.  The appeal of stock buybacks is clear: deferred taxes until you actually close your position, at which point the relevant tax penalties are based on short or long term capital gains.  I wonder, however, if the more nebulous aspects are really understood.  E.g.,:  \n",
    "- Do stock buybacks manipulate buy signals to drive prices higher, or is there an instrinsic reason for prices to rise?\n",
    "- Does the value delivered to investors outweigh the tax penalty on dividends?\n",
    "- Does the market effectively price in stock buybacks?  If not, why?\n",
    "- Don't stock buybacks overly concentrate an investors portfolio?  Wouldn't the dividend be preferable as diversifying with up-to-date information?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to test out various analyses in what follows, first by assuming the efficient market hypothesis (suitably defined) and later allowing for mispricing.  Eventually, I'd like to backtest strategies based on dividendifying buybacks, but that may have to wait for further analysis."
