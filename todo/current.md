## Analyze dividend reinvestment in historic data

See how dividend reinvestment is accounted for in historic data (e.g., the Shiller data).  

A key point to discern is whether reinvested dividends are impactful because of revewed diversification.  I.e., how would an S&P portfolio compare if dividends were reinvested back into the dividend paying stock vs. reinvested back into the broader S&P?

## Try out several trading (optoions-focused) platforms

Pick out the one(s) that look the best and then practice a small transaction with each.  Takes notes on what you like/don't like, and pay very close attention to the _total_ transaction costs from open to close in any given position.  In particular, note if those costs scale per traded option or are per-transaction.

Right now, I'm thinking considering the following platforms.
- Webull
- TastyTrade

### Webull

The paper trading (play money, but tracked against the market) makes this an attractve first-try platform.
