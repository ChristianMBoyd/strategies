## Find finer-grained historical data sources

The Shiller data is useful for summarizing the S&P over the past hundred or so years, but lacks the granulity to see which companies were being tracked at the time.  The point here is to collect alternative data sources worth looking into.

**Consider**
- barchart (free 30 day trial, appears to have at least 30-40 years of data)
- nasdaq has dividend data going back as far as I could tell (I got blocked after two searches though...)
- databento apparently has a pretty good free period, and reasonable rates after
- utilize a graph scraper to extract data from graphs/plots online but not exportable (e.g., Google and other free online plotting tools)


## Analyze dividend reinvestment in historic data

See how dividend reinvestment is accounted for in historic data (e.g., the Shiller data).  

A key point to discern is whether reinvested dividends are impactful because of revewed diversification.  I.e., how would an S&P portfolio compare if dividends were reinvested back into the dividend paying stock vs. reinvested back into the broader S&P?

## Try out several trading (optoions-focused) platforms

Pick out the one(s) that look the best and then practice a small transaction with each.  Takes notes on what you like/don't like, and pay very close attention to the _total_ transaction costs from open to close in any given position.  In particular, note if those costs scale per traded option or are per-transaction.

Right now, I'm thinking considering the following platforms.
- Webull
- TastyTrade

### Webull

The paper trading (play money, but tracked against the market) makes this an attractve first-try platform.
