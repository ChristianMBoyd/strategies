# strategies

Here is a collection of research and analysis to implement medium-to-long term trading strategies.

## Purpose

This repo is mostly meant to organize active areas of research, rather than studying fundamentals or containing applications.  Code will likely be included in the form of test scripts or self-contained analyses, but this repoo is not intended to be a long-term store of all custom analysis packages.

## Quick start

This repo contains notes in markdown and jupyter notebooks with various calculations.  The requirements.txt provided should be all that's needed to jump in.  
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
